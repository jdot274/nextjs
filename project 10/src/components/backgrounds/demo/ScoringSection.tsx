            <span className="text-white font-medium">When you take the SAT, you'll be given a total score between 400 and 1600.</span> As mentioned
            above, the SAT has two major sections: Reading + Writing and Math. You'll earn a scaled score of
            between 200 and 800 points on each section. But where does the scoring scale come from?
          </p>

          <p className="text-white/70 leading-relaxed">
            You start with a raw score for each topic area. <span className="text-white font-medium">Your raw score is simply the number of
            questions you answered correctly;</span> skipped or wrong questions do not add or subtract from your
            raw score. That number is then converted into a scaled score through a process called equatingâ€”
            the College Board is a bit cagey about how exactly this works, but it's based on years worth of data
            rather than how people do on a specific test date.

              The <span className="text-white font-medium">average SAT score is around 1060</span>, with some variation from year to year, but what counts
              as a good score for you will really depend on where you're looking to apply. To get into a top-
              tier school you'll likely need to score about 1500 or higher, but for the local branch of the state
              university you might be just fine with a 1050.
